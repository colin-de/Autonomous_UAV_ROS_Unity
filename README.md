## Simulation instructions

### Prerequisites

We assume you are running Ubuntu 18.04 and have ROS-melodic installed.

Please follow [this](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu) guide for installing ROS-melodic. In short, you need to run these commands:

```
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
```
```
sudo apt install curl
```
```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.asc | sudo apt-key add -
```
```
sudo apt update
```
```
sudo apt install ros-melodic-desktop-full
```
```
sudo apt install python-rosdep python-rosinstall python-rosinstall-generator python-wstool build-essential
```

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```
git clone git@gitlab.lrz.de:00000000014ACFEA/autonomous-systems-2021-group-auto.git
```

Open a terminal and navigate to *AdvancedChallenge1SimAndMapping/catkin_ws*.

Run the below commands to fetch data from the submodules this project depends on:

```
git submodule init
```

```
git submodule update
```

Run `catkin build` to build the workspace.

### Simulation

You will need five terminals. In each terminal, navigate to *AdvancedChallenge1SimAndMapping/catkin_ws* and run `source devel/setup.bash`.

In different terminals, run:

- `roscore`

- `roslaunch simulation simulation.launch`

- `roslaunch controller_pkg controller.launch`

- `roslaunch mapping mapping.launch`

- `roslaunch navigation navigation.launch`

### Unity files
The raw unity files of the 200x200 environment can be downloaded from the following link:
